# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to a respectful, constructive, and harassment-free project community.

Participation in this project should be safe and professional for everyone, regardless of background, identity, experience level, or perspective.

## Expected Behavior

Contributors are expected to:

- communicate respectfully and in good faith
- provide technical feedback that is specific and actionable
- assume positive intent while still being precise about defects and risk
- keep discussions focused on improving code, docs, and operations
- respect review decisions and project boundaries

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behavior is not acceptable:

- harassment, intimidation, personal attacks, or discriminatory language
- threats, doxxing, or publication of private information
- trolling, inflammatory comments, or deliberately disruptive conduct
- repeated bad-faith arguments after maintainers have made decisions
- any behavior that would make a reasonable contributor feel unsafe

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- issues and pull requests
- code review comments
- project discussions and support threads
- any public or private channel used for project collaboration

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for interpreting and enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this policy.

## Reporting

If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior:

1. Open a report issue with enough detail for maintainers to act.
2. If private details are involved, do not post sensitive information publicly; ask maintainers for a private channel in the report.

All reports will be reviewed and handled as promptly as practical.

## Consequences

Maintainers may apply actions proportional to severity and recurrence, including:

- warning
- temporary interaction restrictions
- removal of content
- permanent removal from project participation
