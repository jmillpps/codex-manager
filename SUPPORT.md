## 2) Feature requests

Use GitHub Issues and describe:

- problem statement

## 3) Implementation questions

Use GitHub Discussions if enabled:

- Browse: [`Discussions`](https://github.com/jmillpps/codex-manager/discussions)

If Discussions are not enabled, use GitHub Issues with a clear question title.

Do not publish sensitive vulnerability details in a public issue.

If private reporting is available in your repository settings, use that channel. Otherwise open a minimal issue requesting a private reporting path from maintainers.
